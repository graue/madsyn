<p>Madsyn uses genetic programming to evolve weird noise.
You give it a sound formula, and it generates random
mutations of that formula and plays each of the original and
the mutations for a fixed length of time. Then you try again
with the mutation you like best.</p>

<p>This software is in the public domain.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Madsyn takes a formula on the standard input and outputs
the audio on the standard output, in raw CD-audio format
(44.1 KHz, stereo, 16-bit little-endian linear PCM). This is
really convenient for me because I can pipe its output into
a sound-playing program like this:</p>

<code>madsyn &lt;formula | wavplay -sr</code>

<p>You can also redirect the output into a raw file to open
in an audio editor:</p>

<code>madsyn &lt;formula &gt;output.raw</code>

<p>The full set of options is: <code>madsyn [-f] [-a amp]
[-l len_in_ms] [-m num_mutations].</code></p>

<dl>
<dt>-f</dt>
<dd>Instead of raw CD-audio format, output samples as 32-bit
floats. This lets you avoid clipping and manipulate the
sound using, for example, the effects in my Synth
software.</dd>
<dt>-a amp</dt>
<dd>Set the output amplitude, as a ratio to the default. So
&quot;-a 0.5&quot; will cut the output amplitude in half,
making it about 6 dB softer.</dd>
<dt>-l len_in_ms</dt>
<dd>Set the length in milliseconds for which each formula
(the original and the mutations) will be played. Default is
5000.</dd>
<dt>-m num_mutations</dt>
<dd>The number of mutations to generate; default 3. Set to 0
if you only want to hear the input formula.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Tips</h2>

<p>Start with a simple formula, like the one in sine.madsyn
(<code>time 1000.0 * sin</code>), and eventually evolve
something complicated out of it.</p>

<p>The output can get extremely loud, so watch out for
that.</p>
